- Env: imports failed with ModuleNotFoundError despite an active venv.
  First hypothesis — bare `pip` resolving to system Python — was wrong;
  `which pip` confirmed the venv's own pip.
  Real cause: WSL is Ubuntu 26.04 (resolute), whose default Python is
  3.14. numpy 2.1.3 has no prebuilt wheel for 3.14, so pip fell back to
  a Meson source build, which failed on a missing Python dev dependency.
  Fix: installed python3.12 via the deadsnakes PPA, deleted and rebuilt
  the venv on 3.12. Install became a wheel download instead of a compile.
  Lesson: check wheel availability for your interpreter before pinning
  versions. The newest Python is not the safe choice for the scientific
  stack — it leads the ecosystem, not follows it.
